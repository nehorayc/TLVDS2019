"""
Here we can put code that can be imported from other modules (or the REPL, or the terminal)

When a script is getting too long, that usally means there is too much stuff going
on it, this can cause problems and make it harder to manage.
A good practice is to split the script into different modules (e.g. , .py files)
grouped by their logic.
